# Covid-19-human-temperature-detector-at-doorstep
This project presents the overall design of human temperature detection.  This system is designed to assist and provide support in order to fulfill the  needs of temperature measurement. In this project, we acquaint a  moderate arrangement pointing with increment COVID-19 indoor  wellbeing, covering contactless temperature detecting.


PRINCIPLE:
COVID-19 HUMAN TEMPERATURE DETECTOR works on the principle of 
detecting the human temperature. This detecting of temperature is done 
with the help of Arduino, buzzer and temperature sensor.

OBSERVATIONS
CASE 1: When sensor temperature detects temperature less than 20°C, 
blue LED will glow.
CASE 2: When sensor temperature detects temperature less than 38°C, 
green LED will glow signifying OK body temperature.
P a g e | 29
CASE 3: When sensor temperature detects temperature above 38°C, red 
LED will glow with buzzer beep sound, signifying Danger body 
temperature.
